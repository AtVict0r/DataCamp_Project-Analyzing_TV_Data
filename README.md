## Super Bowl Analysis
This repository contains the code and analysis for a DataCamp workspace project that explores data related to Super Bowl games, halftime shows, and TV viewership. The project involves using pandas and matplotlib to analyze and visualize the data to answer various questions about the Super Bowl spectacle.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is made up of three CSV files:

1. super_bowls.csv - contains game data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018, including game date, venue, teams, scores, and other details.
2. tv.csv - contains TV data for all 52 Super Bowls, including viewership statistics, household ratings, and ad costs.
3. halftime_musicians.csv - contains data about the halftime musicians for all 52 Super Bowls, including the number of songs performed.

# Analysis Questions
In this analysis, the following questions are explored:

1. What are the most extreme game outcomes in terms of points scored?
2. How does the game outcome affect television viewership?
3. How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad costs evolved over time?
4. Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

# Notebooks and Visualizations
The analysis is performed using Python and pandas library in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The notebook provides code snippets, visualizations, and explanations for each step of the analysis.

# Conclusion
This analysis uncovers interesting insights about Super Bowl games, halftime shows, and TV viewership. It reveals trends in viewership, ad costs, and halftime show performances over time. It also explores the impact of game outcomes on television viewership.
